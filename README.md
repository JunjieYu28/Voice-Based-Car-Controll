# Voice-Based-Car-Controll
Our project implements a voice-controlled smart car system. Using a smartphone or computer, users can send voice commands, which are processed through a custom-trained speech recognition model built on the Edge Impulse platform. The recognized commands are then transmitted via Bluetooth to an ESP32 microcontroller, which controls the movement of a small car. This design enables intuitive, hands-free operation and demonstrates the integration of edge AI, wireless communication, and embedded control in a single, user-friendly solution.
